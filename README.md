# R-Programming-Bikeshare-Data

Explore Bikeshare Data
Project Overview
This project provides an interactive analysis of bikeshare data from three major cities in the U.S.: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Using this data, the project demonstrates how Python can be used to answer key questions about bike usage patterns. The project is structured to handle large datasets and provide insights into popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user information.

## Dataset Information
The project works with three datasets, one for each city. The datasets are in CSV format and are structured with the following columns:

- **Start Time**: Date and time when the trip started.
- **End Time**: Date and time when the trip ended.
- **Trip Duration**: Duration of the trip in seconds.
- **Start Station**: The name of the starting station.
- **End Station**: The name of the ending station.
- **User Type**: Subscriber or Customer.
- Additional columns like **Gender** and **Birth Year** may be present for certain cities.

## Project Features
- **Data Loading**: Reads data from CSV files into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Time Statistics**: Calculates the most frequent times of travel.
- **Station Statistics**: Identifies the most popular stations and trip routes.
- **Trip Duration**: Provides total and average trip duration.
- **User Information**: Displays counts of different user types, and where available, gender and birth year statistics.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - time
